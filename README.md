### What did you work on?
Figured out code to move high-torque motors back and forth. Currently working on a method to move the motors independently of each other and the computer (Joystick, switch, etc.)

### What decisions were made?
We decided we would use the 2 high torque motors controlled by a joystick or 2.

### What new resources did you find?
We found the joysticks which can be used as controls for the motors.

### What new issues were discovered?
We discovered that we would need to workshop code based on code in other languages.

### What went well?
We have already generated some code for the joysticks reading the values.

#### What was difficult?
Figuring out the method to indepentently move the motors.

### What is your plan for next week?
The plan is to get the joysticks to move the motors.

### What did we accomplish?

Code now allows for us to control the motors Forwards/Backwards and turning Left/Right.
